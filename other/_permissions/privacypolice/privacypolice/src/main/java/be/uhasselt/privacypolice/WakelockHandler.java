/**
 * This class makes sure that AppStandby on Android 6.0 and up does not interfere with PrivacyPolice
 * (and thus, with normal Wi-Fi operation) by scheduling conservative wakelocks/alarms regularly.
 * This prevents the kind of situation where all apps that need Wi-Fi access are woken up regularly
 * by the OS, whereas PrivacyPolice (having no Activities that are visited regularly by the user)
 * is kept idle, preventing the results of a scan from being passed on to to the
 * PermissionChangeReceiver, and preventing Wi-Fi access for the entire OS.
 * It works by triggering an alarm approximately every 15 minutes, while still adhering to Android's
 * doze mode.
 * TODO: check if this is still needed after the location services fix
