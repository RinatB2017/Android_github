JBox2D Box Demo
=====================

Simple demonstration using the Box2D Java Physics library, Java OpenGL Mathematics (JOML), 
OpenGL ES Graphics 2.0 and Android Studio. Just press you're finger on the screen then watch
a simple shape be created and fall and interact with surrounding objects.

About the Project
---------

* **JBox2D**:  			This application uses the Box2D for Java library to simulate two-dimensional
						real-time physics for the demo.
						
* **JOML**:  			The Java OpenGL Mathematics library is used to calculate matrices for OpenGL
						that OpenGL shaders can use to draw geometry to the screen.
						
* **OpenGL ES 2.0**:  	OpenGL for Embedded Systems is used to draw the geometry to the screen
						combined with the Android UI system. Version 2 was used to maintain maximum device 
						support whilst maintaining a simplistic graphics interface and also provide a useful
						and portable example.
