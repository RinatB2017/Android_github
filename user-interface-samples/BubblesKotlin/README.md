Android Bubbles Sample
===================================

Bubbles are built into the Notification system. They float on top of other app content and follow the user wherever they go. Bubbles can be expanded to reveal app functionality and information, and can be collapsed when not being used.

This example showcases bubbles that can be surfaced by a chat app. For more information on bubbles, see the [Bubbles][1] developer guide.
