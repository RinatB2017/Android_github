# itracing2
itracing2 is a free and open source application that allows to (really?) use iTag devices.

This application runs in background, so you do not have to launch it after each boot up.

several actions are available :

* capture your current position
* ringing your phone
* vibrate your phone
* call a custom URL (GET action)

Manipulate the camera is not allowed unless re-write a entire app (so, this is not my priority)

[you could try the beta version !](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.sylvek.itracing2)
